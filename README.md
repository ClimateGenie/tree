## Problem Statement

Climate change is an urgent crisis demanding action across all societal sectors. However, the spread of climate change misinformation, especially online, impedes necessary measures. This misinformation reaches a broad audience rapidly, outpacing traditional fact-checking and expert countermeasures. As a result, misinformation can strongly influence public opinion.

## Solution: The Climate Genie Web Extension

A proposed solution to this challenge is the **Climate Genie** web extension. This tool is designed to tackle misinformation by:

- Identifying climate change falsehoods online.
- Alerting users to these inaccuracies.
- Providing debunking information and external resources.

## Target Audience

The extension aims to attract a wide user base, mainly those who consume online news and hold concerns regarding climate misinformation. The design prioritizes ease of use and minimal browsing disruption to encourage widespread uptake.

## Current Features of Climate Genie:

- **Misinformation Detection:** Ability to recognize over [80 common](https://i0.wp.com/cardsclimate.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/header_taxonomy.png?fit=1920%2C800&ssl=1) arguments denying the need for action around climate change.
- **Debunking:** Offers users clear explanations and supporting evidence to debunk identified myths.
- **Data Aggregation:** Collects valuable data on misinformation spread and consumption patterns for future strategic interventions.

## Future Development Pathways
