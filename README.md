# Climate Genie Future Prospects

## What Problem Are we solving

Climate Change misinformation excludes members of the general population from contributing meaningfully to climate change discussions by creating an educational inequity.

This misinformation is commonly spread online, and therefore can reach many individuals rapidly. With the increasing prevalence of AI in our modern world, misinformation is being produced at an unprecedented rate, and traditional methods of fact checking are not able to keep up.

## A web extension as a solution to Climate Change Misinformation

Given the spread of climate change misinformation a solution requires a scalable and adaptable method of neutralising climate change misinformation - as such we pose an automated tool that provides educational resources for climate change misinformation at the same rate as it is spread.

A web extension that can read along with users and flag any potential misinformation, while referring readers back to reputable sources will limit misinformation's ability to embed itself in the readers mind.

## Who would use Climate Genie

Most people get their news from the internet, therefore making the potential install base extremely large. We have intentionally made the barrier to entry  extremely low, and the impact on the browsing experience minimal in most cases. This should allow maximal uptake amongst people who are even the slightest bit concerned about climate change misinformation.

## What Climate Genie can Do

Currently, the Climate Genie extension works on most News Sites and Blogs. It can detect and debunk over 80 common pieces of climate change misinformation.

In parallel to this, the climate genie extension functions as a data gathering tool to see what type of misinformation is being read and where.

## Where we can take it in the Future

After releasing the extension, there are many things we can do to improve it or to branch out to new projects.

### Improving Our Modeling

Although our AI model for detecting climate change misinformation is pretty good right now, we still have room to improve it. The ways we can do this are:

 - Increasing the amount of training data or compute power we have for it to improve the performance
 - Increasing the number of common climate denialist arguments that it can detect
 - Remaking the model in different languages to work on a global scale

### Research and Publications

As part of the ongoing development of the extension and it's ability to collect data on it's user's habits, there various possibilities when looking at research projects and reports.

### Academic Work

 - Formal Deconstruction of New Claims
 - A Recreation of the work in Coan 2021 with the improved model
 - Investigating behaviour change with the use of the extension

### Report Style Publications

 - See what misinformation is trending, and potentially provide pre-bunking material 
 - Misinformation produced by each News Outlet
 - Breakdown of misinformation surrounding a hot topic

### Deployment Methods

Currently we provide debunking content through the medium of a web extension. However there are other methods through which it may be usefull, such as:

 - A chatbot
 - Integration with social media (Facebook, X, etc. )
 - App
 - Website
